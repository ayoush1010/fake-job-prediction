# fake-job-prediction
Fake job prediction is a machine learning and data analysis task aimed at identifying and filtering out fraudulent or deceptive job postings. With the rise of online job portals and remote opportunities, scammers often post fake job listings to exploit job seekers for personal information, money, or other malicious intents. These fake jobs can appear convincing, making it difficult for people to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent offers.

By analyzing various features of a job posting—such as the company profile, job description, location, required qualifications, and communication style—fake job prediction models can be trained to detect suspicious patterns. Techniques like natural language processing (NLP), classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks), and anomaly detection are commonly used in this process.

The goal is to improve job-seeking safety by flagging or removing potentially harmful listings before they can cause damage.
